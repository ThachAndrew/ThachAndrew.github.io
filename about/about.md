Iâ€™m currently working in [LINQS](https://linqs.org) lab at UCSC, researching and developing statistical relational learning methods where we perform collective inference on big data.  

We focus on statistical relational learning, probabilistic reasoning and scalable inference, and their applications to problems in computational social science, knowledge discovery, data mining, and computational biology.  On the theoretical side, we introduce new theory and algorithms for efficient reasoning, learning, and inference.  On the practical side, we apply our methods on a range of applications including user modeling, explainable recommender systems, and social good.
