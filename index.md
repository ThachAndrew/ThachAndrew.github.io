Hello World,

[About](about/about.md) 

[Projects](projects/projects.md)


- Iâ€™m currently working in [LINQS](https://linqs.soe.ucsc.edu/) lab at UCSC, learning statistical relational learning where we perform collective inference on big data.  
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any software development or AI/ML research.  
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my other projects that I'm not allowed to post publicly.  
- Current tech hobbies: 
  - Tinkering with Arduinos and Raspberry Pi.  
  - Building custom server-hypervisor systems (jerry-rigged AWS), and unnecessary home automation devices.  
  - rooting/jailbreaking Apple devices.
