Hello World,

- I'm a full stack developer working on AI/ML research in [LINQS](https://linqs.soe.ucsc.edu/) lab at <a href="https://engineering.ucsc.edu/people/anthach"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/UCSC-Baskin%20Engineering-yellow"/></a>, modeling *statistical relational learning* methods where we perform collective inference on big data.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my other projects that I'm not allowed to post publicly.
- Current tech hobbies:
  - Tinkering with Arduinos and Raspberry Pi.
  - Building custom server-hypervisor systems (jerry-rigged AWS), and unnecessary home automation devices.
  - Rooting/jailbreaking Apple devices.
